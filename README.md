# CampusConnect

## Project Title
**CampusConnect**

## Project Description
CampusConnect is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows students and faculty members of an academic institution to interact. This platform will enable users to register, post announcements, and stay connected with each other securely on-chain.

The project leverages the power of smart contracts to provide a transparent and immutable environment for communication and registration on campus.

## Project Vision
The vision behind CampusConnect is to create a secure and open platform for students and faculty, allowing them to communicate seamlessly while promoting transparency, efficiency, and decentralization in educational institutions.

With this project, we aim to enhance campus connectivity and reduce the reliance on centralized systems for announcements, fostering trust among users.

## Key Features
- **User Registration**: Students and faculty members can register their details, specifying their role.
- **Announcement Posting**: Registered users can post announcements for the entire campus community.
- **Secure and Immutable Records**: All data is stored on the blockchain, making it secure and tamper-proof.
- **Decentralized Communication**: Promotes direct communication without the need for centralized entities.
